There was a lot of really funny comments and I honestly took the time to read and upvote every single one of them, even if it was you just telling me I’m gay or boring for the umpteenth time. \n>\n>Thanks to the mods of r/roastme for putting up with this, and making it easier for me to post every day. Sorry for what I can only assume is the hundreds of reports you got because of me. \n>\n>\n>Despite all of your theories, I have nothing to promote. If you are interested in my post-roast 2021+ life. My Twitter account is attached to my Reddit profile, and you can find all my other links/socials from there.\n>\n>Also shoutout to u/jswayswizzle for being my favorite roaster of the year and u/DemolitionCatXXX for being my least favorite. \n>\n>No matter how bad 2021 is, at least it will be an improvement from 2020 since I won’t be posting here every day. Happy New Year everyone!\n\n---\nIf you think this bio helped you roast, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn’t, downvote it. If you’re not sure, leave it to others to decide.</td>

I just need to come in for a minute and give you two of our rules, verbatim. Please follow them moving forward.\n\n---\n\n##Rule 5: The Unfunny Abuse Rule\n\n* There is a clear and definitive line between humor and abuse. If your comment cannot be reasonably expected to make an audience laugh, and is instead meant to intimidate or threaten another user, your posted comment will be removed.\n\n##Rule 12: The 'Don't Be Evil' Rule\n\n* Do not make any comment that can be interpreted as wishing physical harm on someone or urging them to commit an act of violence on themselves or others.\n\n* Do not make jokes at the expense of children, be they actual or implied.\n\n* Do not make any comment that may be construed as malicious concerning anyone's race, religion, or sexual orientation/identity. This is a comedy subreddit. Be funny. Please remember the human.\n\n---\n\nAnother matter I think needs clearing up: the mod team has been in contact with the journalist who submitted this roast and we have verified this account. Please stop reporting it.\n\n---\n\nAnd if you're new here, and don't understand what a roast is, or what we do here, I urge you to read the sidebar, the rules, and a few other comment sections before participating.\n\nA roast is not an insult. A roast is not bullying. A roast is not delivered in anger. We're all here to enjoy this, both roastees and roasters. We're not here to make anyone feel *bad*, we want to get a laugh at each other's expense. We want to have fun. **We don't want to cross that hazy line into personal attacks and abuse.** That is not what RoastMe is for. That is not what Roasting is about.\n\nThis is a comedy subreddit. Please try to be funny.</td>

I only have one close friend and I work a lot, I’m a line cook so I get this kinda shit thrown at me all day and I thought it would be funny, didn’t think it would blow up. Girlfriend of 2 years ghosted me 6 months ago and hasn’t talked to me since. Kinda really fucked me up but I think I’m finally over it. Now I just get really sad about not knowing what to do with my life and wondering if I’ll ever be able to make a difference.  I’ve gotten into music a lot since and have been listening to Marietta, Mom Jeans, Tigers jaw, American Football, and Modern baseball a lot lately. I think Brand New and Silverstein are my favorite bands though\n\n---\nIf you think this bio helped you roast, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn’t, downvote it.

We need to see *an unbroken meat tube between the Roastee's upper torso and the sign that they are holding*. This ensures consent, and eradicates almost any possibility of Photoshop, or holding a sign in front of your friend, or in front of a photo. This is important. This keeps the subreddit fun.\n\nSo please, when submitting a roast please ensure it includes your hand **and your arm**. Please. We're so tired of having this conversation.\n\n--\n\nETA: We've gotten a couple comments about ableism and I just want to address that. If you don't have hands or arms or can't use your hands or arms we do make case by case exceptions to the rule. We just need to be 100% certain that the person in the photo is presenting the sign to us. Can't do that with floating hands.</td>

Let me give you, verbatim, the second part of the Inappropriate Flattery rule:\n\n* Everyone who posts here has consented to getting roasted, attempting to make them feel good about themselves only implies they are incapable of making their own voluntary choices and require special treatment.\n\nWe vet everyone who posts here. If they show any signs of current mental distress we do not allow them to post. Old scars aren't a sign of current mental distress.\n\nAnd, guys, Rule 12. Please. Don't be evil. Don't tell her to cut down the road or the stream or the river or the fucking highway or whatever. It's tired, it's unfunny, and it's, frankly, violent conduct. Any violent comments may get you banned, as many in this thread found out. We do not abide that kind of nonsense here. \n\nPeople are here to be roasted. It's funny. It's fun. We're all consenting adults. People aren't here to be badgered and told to kill themselves. That's not what the subreddit is for.\n\n---\n\nThe thread is unlocked now. *Behave*.</td>

I'm vegan, but not the "ew I can't believe you're eating that" type of vegan. Eat a MR steak in front of me for all I care, but if it's well done, we shall have words. I've never lost a game of taboo in my life. I LOVE reading, and my favorite book is The Godfather, but I think the movie is an abomination. My favorite color is black, my entire wardrobe is black, I want a pet Corvid, snakes are my favorite animals. Death to all mosquitoes. Think of your favorite anime, got it? Death Note is better.\n\n---\nIf you think this bio helped you roast, upvote this comment. If you think it doesn’t, downvote it. If you’re not sure, leave it to others to decide.</td>

Kids who were probably pressured into it &amp; had their comments read in a circle of classmates. \n\nEDIT 2: as several people have pointed out, requiring posters to be the subject of the post would is a good solution to kids posting each other in school.</td>

      <td>Hi all!\n\n&nbsp;\n\nRecently, the moderators of this subreddit were contacted by the Reddit admins, who made us aware that many users had brought our sub to their attention. Specifically, they were made aware of concerns that some bad-faith participants were using our sub to bully minor children. For example, someone posting dozens of kids from their school, without the majority of those people truly knowing what r/RoastMe is or what being roasted entails. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nObviously we take these concerns very seriously. The purpose of r/RoastMe is to be a comedy sub. We want people to laugh, not to be harassed when they come here. Bullying and harassment are also a violation of the Reddit User Agreement, and it is important that we as a subreddit not be seen as running afoul of these rules. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAs a result, we have made some changes to our current rules, which are listed below: \n\n&nbsp;\n\n- All Roastees must be **18 years old or older** in order to be posted on our sub. We are going to be cracking down on posts where the Roastee appears to be underage. This will include photos that were clearly taken in a setting where most people would be <18, such as high school classrooms or photographs of people in high school uniforms. \n\n>> *If your post is wrongly removed for this reason, you may submit proof of your age to us via modmail in order to have your post restored. This will follow the same procedure that we currently use to verify that users are over the age of 16.*\n\n- **All** of the people in the photograph must consent to being Roasted. Consent is **the most important rule** on our subreddit. This means that photographs with bystanders whose faces are visible or who are otherwise identifiable *will be removed*. Do not take pictures in crowded areas where lots of other people are in the background. Every single person in the picture must be aware of the sign, and must be indicating their intent to be roasted (by holding the sign, pointing to it, etc.).\n\n>> *We previously had a rule in place to forbid bystanders from being roasted. This new rule is replacing that rule, and cutting off the opportunity for non-consenting people to be roasted on the front-end, rather than relying on back-end comments policing.*\n\n- This also means that we will be removing posts where it is not clear that the person pictured understands what Reddit is, or consents to being roasted. This includes posts with titles like "She doesn't know what Reddit is, what better way to show her!" or "My friend doesn't speak English, Roast Him!" You can still post pictures of your friends, your coworkers, or your Fantasy Football league members, but **everyone** needs to be in on the fun.\n\n>> Please be mindful of how you title your posts. Just like we do with underage users, we will be tracking people who post non-consenting Roastees and we will ban you if you try to post that person again. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe know that some of these rule changes may be annoying, frustrating, or inconvenient, particularly for our international users, where 16 is the age of majority. However, given that Reddit is an American company, we need to comply with the rules of majority for the USA. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nWe are making these rule changes to comply with the Reddit admins' requests and because we want to be transparent with you, the users, about the things that can get our subreddit in trouble. The new rules are a modified version of the rule changes that were proposed to us by the admins. We ask that you also be vigilant in reporting posts that appear to break the new rules, or send us a modmail if you notice a particularly problematic user who is ruining the fun for everyone else. \n\n&nbsp;\n\nAnd hey, fuck you :)</td>
